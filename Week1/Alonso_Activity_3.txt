List and Loops Activity

1. Suppose that there is a list of strings defined, called samples. Define the list so that some strings have only one or two characters and
   some strings have more. Write a loop that prints out all the strings whose length is greater than two. 

Code: 
# Create a list of ten items 
samples = ['oh', 'trout', 'yelich', 'harper', 'ryu', 'choi', 'ohtani', 'at', 'sb', 'warp']

# Print strings that have a length greater than 2
for i in samples: 
    if len(i) > 2:
        print(i)

Result: 
trout
yelich
harper
ryu
choi
ohtani
warp

2. Again, suppose that there is a list of strings defined, called samples. Define the list so that some strings have only one or two characters
   and some strings have more than five. Write a loop that prints out all the strings whose length is greater than two and whose length is less
   than five. 


Code: 
# Create a list of ten items 
samples = ['oh', 'trout', 'yelich', 'harper', 'ryu', 'choi', 'ohtani', 'at', 'sb', 'warp']

# Print only the strings that have more than 2 characters and less than 5
for i in samples:
    if len(i) > 2 and len(i) < 5:
        print(i)

Results: 
ryu
choi
warp
