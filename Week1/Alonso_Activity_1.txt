Activity 1
1. What will the following code print out?
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

Answer: b) 44

2. Write a sequence of statements into the Python interpreter to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour, printing each one, and then to 
   compute gross pay as (hours * rate). Your output lines should look something like: 

hours = input("Enter hours: ")
rate = input("Enter rate: ")
pay = (float(hours) * float(rate))
print("Pay: ", pay)

Enter hours: 35
Enter rate: 2.75
Pay:  96.25

3. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
    width = 17
    height = 12.0

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and its type.
1. width/2 -> 8.5, type: float
2. width/2.0 -> 8.5, type: float
3. height/3 -> 4.0, type: float
4. 1 + 2 * 5 -> 11, type: int
