Boolean and Conditional Statements

Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0
and 1.0, print a grade using the following table: 

Score       Grade 
>=0.9         A 
>=0.8         B 
>=0.7         C 
>=0.6         D 
< 0.6         F 

Code:
# Prompt user to enter a grade 
grade = input("Enter Score: ")

try:
    if float(grade) <= 1.0 and float(grade) >= 0.9:
        print("Grade: A")
    elif float(grade) < 0.9 and float(grade) >= 0.8:
        print("Grade: B")
    elif float(grade) < 0.8 and float(grade) >= 0.7:
        print("Grade: C")
    elif float(grade) < 0.7 and float(grade) >= 0.6: 
        print("Grade: D")
    elif float(grade) < 0.6:
        print("Grade: F")
    else:
        print("Bad Score")
except:
    print("Bad Score")

Results:
Enter Score: 0.95
Grade: A

Enter Score: 10.0
Bad Score

Enter Score: perfect
Bad Score

Enter Score: 0.75
Grade: C

Enter Score: 0.5
Grade: F
