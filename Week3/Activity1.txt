# Read file; Calculate averages and maximum
# Created by: Martin Alonso
# Date created: 2019-04-12

# Purpose: reads a txt file, calculates the maximum and average values for numeric columns

# Import numpy for mean calculation, import pandas for dataframe manipulation. 
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd

# Prompts user to enter the file name. 
to_open = input("What file do you want to open? ")

# Attempts to open the file; if file is not in directory, returns an error. 
try: 
    NBAfile = open(to_open, "r")
except: 
    print("File is not in directory.")

# Cleans file data using list comprehension. 
NBAlist = [line.strip().split("\t") for line in NBAfile.readlines()]
NBAlist2 = [list(filter(None, x)) for x in NBAlist]

# Converts list to DataFrame; adds column headers and converts attendance and ticket prices to int and float. 
NBAdf = pd.DataFrame(NBAlist2)
NBAdf.columns = ['team', 'attendance', 'ticket_price']
NBAdf['attendance'] = NBAdf.attendance.astype(int)
NBAdf['ticket_price'] = NBAdf.ticket_price.astype(float)

# Calculate maximum attendance and ticket price
max_attendance = max(NBAdf['attendance'])
max_ticket_price = max(NBAdf['ticket_price'])

# Calculate average attendance and ticket price
avg_attendance = np.mean(NBAdf['attendance'])
avg_ticket_price = np.mean(NBAdf['ticket_price'])

# Returns the values 
print("The largest crowd-size was {:d}, while the average crowd-size was {:.2f}.".format(max_attendance, avg_attendance))
print("The most expensive ticket cost ${:.2f}, while the average ticket cost ${:.2f}.".format(max_ticket_price, avg_ticket_price))

#### Results
(base) python Activity1.py
What file do you want to open? NBA-attendance-1989.txt
The largest crowd-size was 26160, while the average crowd-size was 15710.70.
The most expensive ticket cost $29.18, while the average ticket cost $18.57.
