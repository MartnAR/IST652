    using the csv reader 
    and stores it in a list of dictionaries, one for each player
  Each line has the team, the player name, the salary and the position played.

  The program writes a report on the average salary per player to a txt file.
  The program writes the players who made less than $310,000 to a csv file
    using the csv writer with a header line suitable for excel.
